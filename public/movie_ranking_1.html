 <h2>My Favourite Poem</h2>
 
   <p>One ought not to long for what has passed away,<br />
   nor be anxious over things that are yet to come.<br />
   The past has left us, the future has not arrived.<br />
   </p>
   <p>
   Whoever sees the present dhammas direct and clear just as they are,<br /> 
   is unshakable, immovable, secure.<br />
   They should accumulate such moments.<br />
   </p>
   <p>
   Effort is the duty of today, even tomorrow death may come.<br />
   For it is beyond our power to delay Death and its great armies.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Sages of Peace speak of that one who strives<br />
   never lazy throughout the entire day and night:<br />
   "Praise the one who truly lives for even a single night."<br />
   </p>
